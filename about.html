<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>Welcome to Fresh Bites! We are a team of three: Htet Shin Thant Aung, Win Lae May, and Lwin Htet Aung(me). Together, we work hand in hand to serve our customers and prepare delicious food with care.</p>
<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Our journey in creating this cozy cafe began with a shared dream among best friends. We were eager to start a business together, so we searched online for a small vacant space. Once we found the perfect spot, we poured our hearts into bringing Fresh Bites to life, working together to make it a welcoming place for everyone</p>
